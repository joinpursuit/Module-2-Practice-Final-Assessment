<!-- This **burp** app should have (in order of placement in the HTML):
- A title tag that starts with the text "Szechuan Sauce"
- A header tag. Make it mean and make it green. 
- Inside the header an `h1` that reads "Rick & Morty" with fantasy font.
- Inside the header an image of Rick and Morty (check your assets folder!)

- A `ul` with the id `all-characters` that contains an `li`'s with an image (id=`photo-img`) of each character in the API (first page only), as well as the characters name.
- A `main` tag that starts not on the page
- Inside of `main` should be two sections. The first section should have the id `character-info` the second should have the id `character-comments-section`.
- Inside of `character-info` should be be an `h3` an `img` and two `p` tags. 
- Inside of `character-comments-section` should be a `form`, including a "text" `input` and a "submit" `input`, that allows users to submit (not save, just add to the frontend) what they would say about the character Jerry. On submission the input should clear.
- Also insider `character-comments-section`  should be a `ul` with the id `character-comments-ul` that contains the submitted comments of each character.

Please feel free to include additional `section`s and elements if they make styling the **burp** app easier. -->
